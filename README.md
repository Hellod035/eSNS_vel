# eSNS-vel Library
`Version 0.2.3 beta`

The Saturation in the Null-Space (SNS) Inverse-Kinematics (IK) Library
implements a collection of algorithms written by Fabrizio Flacco for
inverting the differential kinematics of a robot.

## References:

The algorithms in this library are drawn from three papers,
all written by the same team of three authors:
- Fabrizio Flacco
- Alessandro De Luca
- Oussama Khatib

The primary reference is:
- *Control of Redundant Robots Under Hard Joint Constraint: Saturation in the Null Space*
